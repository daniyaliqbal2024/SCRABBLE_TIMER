# SCRABBLE_TIMER


 
Summary

            D-Scrabble Timer is an Android Application which will allow scrabble players to have a timer and dictionary in their smart phones. D-Scrabble Timer will also have a built-in Anagram Solver that will allow users to find any words with the tiles they have on their racks. Users will also be able to keep their scores as well as track of letter tiles. D-Scrabble Timer will allow users to have free timers on their smartphones rather than buying one. A physical timer, is very specific in what it does and can cost more that 60$ in US and Canada. 
Significance

The scope of this project fits well with the Object Oriented Software Development course and the Mobile App Development course.  The programming language that will be used to create this application is Java. Java, like C++, is an object-oriented program language.  Many of the skills that were learned in the Object-Oriented Software Development course, such as the creation of classes/methods, instance of the classes (objects), and the active manipulation of data held in the objects through user-interface interaction will be used to input, update, and store nutrition data.  This project will build upon skills learned in Object Oriented Software Development but will demand a much higher level of functionality as well as a more robust user interface to have an enjoyable user experience.  To create a well-designed user interface, skills learned in Mobile App Development  such as, avoiding cognitive overload and innate user error prevention, will make users feel comfortable, and will avoid confusion while entering nutritional information and navigating the application. 



Required Tools and Availability

	This project will be developed in Android Studio with the Java programming language.  This can be accessed in the DePauw computer labs as well as on my personal laptop that already has Android Studio downloaded.

Demonstration Plans

	The demonstration will take place in the Julian building.  The code can be presented in Android Studio from my computer.  The application can be built and then presented on Android Virtual Device on my computer.

Qualifications	

	I have basic knowledge of Android application development with Java from the Mobile App Development course I took during my sophomore year. During this course, to become familiar with the tools in Android Studio, I built a variety of mini, sample applications.  Additionally, the completion of courses such as Object Oriented Software Development, Data Structures, and Full Stack Development has equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to develop a fully functioning Android application.

Project Specification	

The goal of this application is to make a very cost effective and easy using Scrabble Timer and Dictionary.  The user interface will present the Users to choose the clock time on both sides (usually 25 minutes in both sides). There will be an option to pause the timer. Under each clock, there will be a score tracker, where the user is going to input their individual scores every time, they press the clock. There is also going to be a tile tracker. For example, in scrabble there are 12 E letters in the bag. Every time a move is played, we can cut the Tile in the tracker. The app will also have an Anagram searcher with constraints. The user can put down any number of letters in the search box and it’s going to return all the possible accurate words that can be made of those letters. The Anagram searcher is also going to have a restrictive constraint. If we want a specific letter to be in a specific position for the word, the anagram searcher is going to return the word that follows that constraint. 
Technical Details	

	I plan on using CSW21 dictionary (which is the current scrabble dictionary). If not available, I plan on making a list of words and using that as a dictionary. I plan on making different pages for each of the facilities for the timer. As soon as the user opens the timer, they will have the option of choosing between the Anagram Searcher, Timer, and Word Search. Each of those clicks(using the onClickListener method) will redirect them to that specific page. For the Anagram Searcher with constraints, my plan is to play with case sensitivity of alphabets when the user is writing down the letters. 

Timeline

Checkpoint 1:

•	By the first checkpoint, I wanted to have made the user interface as well as the timer portion of the app.
•	This all will be done on Android Studio Android Virtual Device

Checkpoint 2:

•	By the second checkpoint, I would’ve liked to have completed the Word Searcher for the timer. 
•	I would also like to have complete setting up the design for my main page. 
•	I would like to start working on the Tile Tracker as well. 


Checkpoint 3:

•	By this time, I want to have completed the Anagram Searchers. 
•	I will have the Tile Tracker completed as well



Checkpoint 4:

•	I would be able to add the constraints to my anagram searcher.
•	I want to be able to add the score in my timer as well.
•	I want to have completed the design of my app completely.


Future Enhancements

•	The application can be converted into a scrabble game itself, with features such as timers and dictionary. 
•	We can put in word challenges for young users who are learning the game. We can give challenges, such as showing them certain tiles, and they have to guess the correct words out from them.
